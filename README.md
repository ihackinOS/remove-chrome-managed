## 🔍 What is “Managed by your organization” in Chrome?

When you see this message, it means your Chrome browser is being controlled by system policies (from Windows Registry).

This often results in:

- 🛠️ **Unwanted policies** from installed software  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Malware or spyware** forcing hidden extensions  
- 🖥️ **Admin policies** from old work/school accounts  
- ❌ **Restricted Chrome settings** (e.g. cannot change homepage, search engine, etc.)  
- 🌐 **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)** being blocked or grayed out  

> 🧨 **Yes! Even your secure DNS settings might not work properly**  
> If you can't enable DNS over HTTPS in Chrome settings, this is often caused by policy restrictions.
